# Introduction

Dear Corine,
As you embark on a journey in the land of web application firewalls, we felt it necessary thank you for your contributions to SCION and to the team. 

# SCION Standardization Achievements

Your work on SCION brought order to chaos, transforming arcane networking concepts and loads of research papers into a comprehensible SCION book first and then into Internet Drafts. 

# Wishing You the Best

As you venture into new realms beyond SCION, we wish you luck in navigating the treacherous seas of web application firewalls, with new acronyms and documentation challenges.
